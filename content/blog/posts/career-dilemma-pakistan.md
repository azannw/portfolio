In Pakistan, it has always been difficult for children to choose what they truly want to do in life. From a very young age, decisions are often made for them by parents, relatives, and society. Instead of being encouraged to explore their interests, they are told what path to follow. Over time, this slowly kills curiosity, creativity, and independent thinking. A child who keeps hearing what is "right" and what is "wrong" eventually starts believing that questioning is a mistake and that obedience is the only way to succeed.

For a long time, certain professions were treated as the ultimate definition of success. Medicine, engineering, and a few government-related careers became the standard. Parents pushed their children toward these paths because, at one point, they guaranteed financial stability, respect, and social approval. Institutions like UET or medical colleges became dreams not because the child wanted them, but because society validated them.

What was rarely asked was a very basic question: what do you actually want to do? Does this field excite you? Can you imagine waking up every day for the next twenty or thirty years doing this without feeling empty? Does it give you peace, energy, and meaning, or does it only give you stress and pressure?

Most children never get the chance to answer these questions honestly. Many are emotionally pushed into fulfilling dreams that were never theirs. Sometimes it is a parent's unfulfilled desire. Sometimes it is pressure from relatives. Sometimes it is just the fear of being judged. Slowly, this turns into guilt. Guilt for thinking differently. Guilt for wanting more from life than what is expected.

We have normalized wasting years just to prove someone wrong. Taking gap years not to grow, but to satisfy egos. Studying something you hate just to keep others happy. And the harsh truth is, the same people who pressure you today will not be there when you feel lost, burned out, or empty inside. They will not carry the weight of your regrets.

If you are someone facing this right now, hear this clearly. You have to stand up for yourself. You have to be a little stubborn. Not arrogant, not disrespectful, but firm. If you cannot fight for what you want, then maybe you do not want it badly enough. And if you truly want something, you will keep trying, even when it gets uncomfortable. Even when no one understands you.

Trust this: when you genuinely work towards something you love, Allah opens paths you never imagined. He tests your patience first, but when He sees sincerity, He creates ways for you. You start doing things you once thought were impossible. You start becoming the person you once doubted you could be.

Live your life for yourself. Not for society, not for relatives, not to meet someone else's expectations. You are not getting another life. Do not waste it chasing approval. Chase purpose. Chase growth. Chase the thing that makes you feel alive.

Money, recognition, and stability will eventually come when you are truly good at what you do. But peace, fulfillment, and inner satisfaction only come when you are aligned with what you love. That is real success. And once you taste that, nothing else compares.
